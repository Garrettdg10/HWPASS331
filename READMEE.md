## Random Password Generator

This project was built to generate random passwords to a desired length while using a combination of upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters depending on what the user selected. This solves the problem of password security by generating completely random passwords based on the users desires. I learned to apply prompts and confirms to guide the user while creating error messages for when the user went out of the range of the app.

## Installation
I first pseudo coded the steps needed to create this project. First was to set up prompts to make the user aware of the parmaters of the password and ask what they specifically wanted. Next, was to create the pool of characters the password generator could choose from, and finally insert the choices into an equation to generate password.
